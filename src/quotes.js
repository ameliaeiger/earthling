// On Foot I Had to Cross the Solar System
// On foot
// I had to cross the solar system
// before I found the first thread of my red dress.
// I sense myself already.
// Somewhere in space hangs my heart,
// shaking in the void, from it stream sparks
// into other intemperate hearts. 

// Edith Sodergran

// Evening

// The chimneys, rank on rank,
// Cut the clear sky;
// The moon,
// With a rag of gauze about her loins
// Poses among them, an awkward Venus â€”

// And here am I looking wantonly at her
// Over the kitchen sink.

// Richard Aldington
